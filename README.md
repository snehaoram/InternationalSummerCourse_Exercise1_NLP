You are advised to take up the following tasks:
 1. Compute the values of net1, O1, net2 and O2 in the function forward propagation(). The notations are kept consistent with the lecture.
 2. Update the parameters in the function update parameters()
 3. Use different values of epoch (i.e., iterations) and learning rate (to direct rate of convergence) from the Hyper-parameter space given. The correct output you should obtain is [[1. 0. 0. 1.]]
 4. Implement the XOR network with no hidden layer, and use sin as the activation function (instead of the sigmoid function).

**Few Instructions:**
Please write your code in the designated spaces provided. See for the text – ‘Write your code here’. For training use different combinations of epochs and learning rate. Please do not edit in anywhere else in the code.
